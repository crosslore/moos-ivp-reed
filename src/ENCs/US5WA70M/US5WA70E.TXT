Acoustic sensors, consisting of a concrete anchor and
tethered instrument package floating above the anchor,
are positioned approximately 915 metres/1000 yards apart 
along theline. The depth of the floating portion of the 
instrument varies with local bottom depth. For instruments anchored
at less than 150 metres/492 feet depth (near shore), the floating portion
of the instrument is within 5 metres/16 feet of the bottom. For instruments
anchored at 150 metres/492 feet depth or greater, the instrument package
is tethered approximately 150 metres/492 feet below the water surface.
