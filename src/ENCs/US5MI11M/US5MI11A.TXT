NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for infor-
mation not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low
Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances
are reduced correspondingly. For see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION – TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LAKE ERIE FISH NETTING AREAS
Various types of nets are employed in Lake Erie of
which gill nets, impounding nets and trap nets may
create a hazard to mariners. These are marked by
buoys or stakes. The areas most
intensively fished and the principal type of nets em-
ployed. However, fishing gear may be encountered at
any location. 


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


CAUTION - GAS PIPELINES AND WELLS
Gas pipelines and wells contain natural gas under pressure, and
damage to these installations would create an immediate fire hazard.
Vessels anchoring in Lake Erie should do so with caution after noting
the underwater, and therefore concealed, positions of all oil and gas
wells, pipelines, submarine cables and other installations.


CAUTION - OIL AND GAS
Mariners are advised that oil and gas drilling towers are temporarily established
in various parts of Lake Erie. These towers exhibit a Quick Flashing White Light and
each is equipped with an automatic fog signal sounding one blast of 2 seconds
duration followed by 18 seconds of silence.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at
the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan and Buffalo, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Adrian, MI     WNG-647    162.450 MHz
Cleveland, OH  KHB-59     162.550 MHz
Detroit, MI    KEC-63     162.550 MHz
Grafton, OH    WNG 698    162.500 MHz
Sandusky, OH   KHB-97     162.400 MHz
Toledo, OH     WXL-51     162.550 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given 
thereon are in statute miles between points of departure.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by 
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association
