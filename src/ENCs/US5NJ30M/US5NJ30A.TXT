Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers,
U.S. Coast Guard, and State of New Jersey Bureau of Navigation.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.


CAUTION - ALL CRAFT
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the appropriate chart is consulted. 
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway
southward from Manasquan Inlet to Cape May,
NJ, aids with yellow triangles should be kept on
the starboard side of the vessel and aids with
yellow squares should be kept on the port side
of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.
All lights and lighted buoys marking the Intra-
coastal Waterway show a flash every
four seconds, unless otherwise specified.
The aids marking tributary channels, in gen-
eral, are maintained by the state of New Jersey.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway.  Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop.  A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilots 2 and 3 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers /
20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

New York, NY		KWO-35		162.550 MHz
Atlantic City, NJ	KHB-36		162.400 MHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should
pass port to port.
When Motorboats approach each other at right angles or
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels, when
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication
"Navigation Rules".


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilots 2 and 3. Additions
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in
Boston, Massachusetts, the 5th Coast Guard
District in Portsmouth, Virginia, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in New York, New York or in Philadelphia
Pennsylvania.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channel are
subject to shoaling particularly at the edges.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary
(USCGAUX) national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States, For information
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander of USPS Headquarters, Post OfficeBox
30423, Raleigh, N.C. 27612, 919-821-0281.
USCGAUX - 1st Coast Guard District, 408 Atlantic Ave., Boston, MA 02110-
2209, Tel. 617-223-8310 or USCG Headquarters (G - BAU), Washington D.C.
20593-0001


CAUTION - USACE
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor
navigation conditions. these surveys are not
intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted
features hazardous to surface navigation are not
expected but may exist in federal channels.


NOTE H
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Service (VTS) system in the New York Bay and sur-
rounding areas, Vessel operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate vessel traffic management within the VTS area.
