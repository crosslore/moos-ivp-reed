NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

WARNING - SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small craft warnings 
will be displayed from sunrise to sunset on Suffolk 
Country Marine Police Patrol Boats while underway 
in the coastal and navigable inland waters of 
Suffolk Country, Long Island, New York. 

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than 19.8 meters/65 feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."

CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 22.2 kilometers per hour/12 Knots, requiring 
a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.

CAUTION - OYSTER GROUNDS
Oyster grounds are marked by stakes and 
flags. Submerged broken stakes become 
dangerous obstructions to small craft.

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

CAUTION- SMALL CRAFT, ALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.

POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153)


NOTE H
The U.S. Coast Guard Operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the New York Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161,the
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable water of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate vessel traffic management within the VTS area.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
The National Ocean Service acknowledges the 
exceptional cooperation received from members
of the Oyster Bay Power Squadron, District 3, 
United States Power Squadrons, in continually 
providing essential information for revising this 
chart.
