NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION  USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS) 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 1 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Notice to Mariners.  During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.s. coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 1. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the office of the commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the office of the District engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.  Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 32 to 64 kilometres / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 161 kilometres / 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Ellsworth, ME		KEC-93		162.40 MHz
Dresden, ME		WXM-60		162.475 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels.


Administration Area
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot



CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Imagery and Mapping Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


COLREGS, 80.105(see note A)
International Regulations for preventing collisions at sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
