One-way traffic lanes are present on this chart in the vicinity of Smith Point and are RECOMMENDED for all vessels except small craft. They have been designed to aid in the prevention 
of collisions but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. The recommended route is marked by a fairway buoy and separates the courses of inbound and outbound vessels. Vessels should leave the buoy on their port hand.
