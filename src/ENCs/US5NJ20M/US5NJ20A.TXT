NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chap-
ter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 3. Additions or revisions to
Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Marin-
ers. Information concerning the regulations may
be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 5th
Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engi-
neers in Philadelphia, PA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 3 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard,
and State of New Jersey, Bureau of Navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial - Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the
passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.
Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in
which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the
wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find
themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stem waves can be hazardous
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close
to their bows.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, National
Organizations of Boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs in
communities throughout the United States. For information regarding these
free educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS National Headquarters, post Office
Box 30423, Raleigh, North Carolina 27612.
USCGAUX - 5th Coast Guard District, Federal Building, 431 Crawford St.,

(G-BAU), Washington, D.C.20593-0001.


STORM WARNING DISPLAYS
Storm warning signals are displayed from
masts of Police Patrol Boats while underway
along the New Jersey coast and the Inland
Waterway.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY
PROJECT DEPTHS: The project depth is 1.8 meters/6 feet Manasquan Inlet, NJ 
to Ottens Harbor, NJ; 3.0 meters/10 feet Otters Harbor, NJ to 
Richardson Channel, NJ; 3.6 meters/12 feet Richardson Channel, NJ 
to Cape May Inlet, NJ
The controlling depths are published periodically
in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners.
Uncharted shoals may exist in areas which have
not been recently surveyed. Please report shoals
and obstructions at:
https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/staff/contact.htm
DISTANCES
The general location of the Waterway is indicated.
Mariners are advised to follow
the aids to navigation and avoid charted shoals
and obstructions.
Mileage distances shown along the Waterway 
are in Statute Miles, Southward from Manasquan
Inlet Entrance (US5NJ30M) and are indicated
One Statute Mile equals 0.87 Nautical Miles / 1.6 Km.
Courses are TRUE and must be CORRECTED 
for any variation and compass deviation.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway exhibits unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway
southward from Manasquan Inlet to Cape May,
NJ, aids with yellow triangles should be kept on
the starboard of the vessel and aids with
yellow squares should be kept on the port side
of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.
All lights and lighted buoys marking the Intra-
coastal Waterway on this chart show a flash every
four seconds, unless otherwise specified.
The aids marking tributary channels, in gen-
eral, are maintained by the state of New Jersey.


CAUTION
Oyster grounds are marked by stakes and
flags. Submerged broken stakes become
dangerous obstructions to small craft.


CAUTION
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor
navigation conditions. These surveys are not
intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted
features hazardous to surface navigation are not
expected but may exist in federal channels.
