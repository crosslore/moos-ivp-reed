One-way traffic lanes overprinted  are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels traveling between the
points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collision at the approach to Boston Harbor, but
are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable rules of the road. The separation zone is intended
to separate inbound and outbound traffic to be free of ship traffic. The separation zone should not be used except for
crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and the separation zone use extreme caution. See Charts 13200(US3EC09) and 13267(US4MA13M).
