NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the 
nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations 
are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 2.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard 
District in Boston, MA or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS	
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 
40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Meriden, CT             WXJ-42     162.400 MHZ
New London, CT       	KHB-47     162.550 MHZ
Providence, RI          WXJ-39     162.400 MHZ
Riverhead, NY           WXM-80     162.475 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine 
pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. 
Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids 
has been omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small-craft warnings will be displayed from sunrise to sunset on Suffolk County Police Patrol boats
underway on the waters around Long Island, New York.
 
               
FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices and structures such as fish traps, pound nets, crab traps, and duck blinds, 
some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in the near shore area. Mariners should proceed with caution.
