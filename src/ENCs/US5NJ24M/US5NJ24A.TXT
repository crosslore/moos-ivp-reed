NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION  USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS) 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION  TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING  PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 3.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 5thCoast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA or at the Office of the District Engineer,  Corps of Engineers in Philadelphia, PA. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio Station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

CAUTION  SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION  DREDGED AREAS 
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION  USACE CONDUCTS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with nautical charts, and the exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart is consulted. Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal  Waterway exhibits unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waterways.  When following the Intracoastal Waterway southward from Manasquan Inlet to Cape May, NJ, aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the starboard of the vessel and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.  All lights and lighted buoys marking the Intracoastal Waterway on this chart show a flash every four seconds, unless otherwise specified.
The aids marking tributary channels, in general, are maintained by the state of New Jersey.


CAUTION  SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels even if small craft have the right-of-way.  All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION  WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.  Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stem waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, National Organizations of Boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information regarding these free educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS National Headquarters, post Office Box 30423, Raleigh, North Carolina 27612.
USCGAUX - 5th Coast Guard District, Federal Building, 431 Crawford St., Portsmouth, VA 23704-5004, Tel. 804-398-6208 or USCG Headquarters (G-BAU), Washington,D.C.20593-0001.


STORM WARNING DISPLAYS
Storm warning signals are displayed form masts of Police Patrol Boats while underway along the New Jersey coast and the Inland Waterway..
