NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys, and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S.
Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, British Admiralty
and Canadian charts.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilots 1,2, and 3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2
are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information con-
cerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA, and
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA,
or the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
New York, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - MAGNETIC VARIATION
Magnetic variation curves are for 2012 derived from
2015 World Magnetic Modei and accompanying secular
change. If annual change is in same direction as variation
it is additive and the variation is increasing. If annual
change is opposite in direction to variation it is subtractive
and the variation is decreasing.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
One way traffic lanes are recommended 
for use by all vessels traveling between the points involved. They have 
been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches 
to Portland Harbor and New York Harbor and the approach to 
Narragansett Bay, Buzzards Bay and Boston Harbor and for routing 
traffic through the Bay of Fundy but are not intended in an way to super-
sede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. Separation Zones are 
intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to be free of 
ship traffic. Separation zones should not be used except for crossing 
purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme 
caution. 
The recommended route in the Bay of Fundy has been established 
by the Department of Transport, Canada. See large scale Canadian 
charts.
