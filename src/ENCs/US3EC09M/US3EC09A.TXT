NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and
Canadian Charts.
 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilots 1 & 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are 
published in the Notice to Mariners. Information con-
cerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of 
the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA 
or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEMES
One-way traffic lanes are RECOMMENDED for use by all
vessels traveling between the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the
prevention of collisions at the approaches to New York Harbor and the approach to
Boston Harbor but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules
of the Road. Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic
and to be free of ship traffic. Separation zones should not be used except for crossing
purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution.
Recommended traffic lanes have been established for the approach to
Narragansett Bay and Buzzards Bay. See Charts 12300 and 13218.
