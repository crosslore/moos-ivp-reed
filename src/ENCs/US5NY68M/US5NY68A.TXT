NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Aids to navigation in the Cayuga and Seneca Canal are the responsibility of the New York State Thruway Authority. All lighted 
aids, stationary and floating, unless otherwise indicated display a 1 second flash every 4 seconds.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the 
nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations 
are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months 
or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard 
Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard 
District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and New York State Thruway Authority.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception  range is typically 20 to 
40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Rochester, NY   KHA-53          162.400 MHz (Chan WX-2)
Syracuse, NY	WXL-31		162.550 MHz (Chan WX-1)


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine 
pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. 
Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.  Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids 
has been omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://coops.nos.noaa.gov.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Normal Pool Level, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances
see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.




CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions, some features charted as visible at Normal Pool Level may be submerged, particularly in 
the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed  with caution.
