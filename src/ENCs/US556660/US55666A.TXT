LIDAR SURVEYS:
Much of the hydrogrphy on this chart is based on surveys using air borne Laser Image Detection and Ranging, or LIDAR. The ability of LIDAR to detect depths and hazards is limited by water conditions, such as water clarity, depth, and the state of the sea surface. Therefore, certain LIDAR-surveyed areas are not thoroughly examined, particularly in areas with depths greater than 30 meters. In such areas, additional sources may have been used. See source diagram for detailed limits of survey areas.

SURVEY SOUNDING DATUM:
0.3 meters below Mean Low Water Springs.

POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum through the use of a orthorectified satellite image.

CAUTION:
QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA - The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of Data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of Zone of Confidence in Data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.
